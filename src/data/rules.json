Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled contition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).",

            "A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach sucha target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle."
